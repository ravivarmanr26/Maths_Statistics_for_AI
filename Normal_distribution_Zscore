Normal Distribution:
Definition:
A normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a symmetric probability distribution that is characterized by a bell-shaped curve. In a normal distribution:

The mean (average) is at the center.
The spread of data is determined by the standard deviation.
The majority of data falls within one, two, or three standard deviations from the mean.
Example:
Imagine you are collecting the heights of students in a college. If the heights follow a normal distribution, most students will have heights around the average height (mean), and very few will be extremely tall or extremely short.

Use Cases in Data Science:

Many natural phenomena, such as human height, test scores, and errors in measurements, often follow a normal distribution.
Normal distribution is frequently assumed in statistical methods, making it a fundamental concept in hypothesis testing and parameter estimation.
Z-Score:
Definition:
A Z-score (or standard score) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a distribution. It helps to understand where a particular data point stands relative to the rest of the data.

Example:
If the average height of students is 160 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm, and a student has a height of 170 cm, the Z-score would be +1.0. This indicates that the student's height is one standard deviation above the average.

Use Cases in Data Science:

Identifying outliers: Z-scores can be used to detect data points that deviate significantly from the average, helping in outlier detection.
Standardization: Z-scores are used to standardize data, making it easier to compare different datasets or variables on a common scale.
Simplified Explanation:
Imagine normal distribution as a shape of data that looks like a bell, where most of the data is in the middle and tails off as you move away. The Z-score is like a way of saying how far a single piece of data is from the middle of that bell, helping us understand if it's typical or unusual.

In data science, normal distribution helps us understand how common or rare certain values are, and Z-scores help us measure and compare individual values in terms of standard deviations from the average.
